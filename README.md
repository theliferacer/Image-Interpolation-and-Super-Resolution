# Image-Interpolation-and-Super-Resolution
The projectâ€™s objective is to implement Image interpolation and Super-resolution algorithms and compare visual results between them.We have Implemented a GUI to apply these algorithms easily on required Images. the features of Nearest Neighbor Interpolation, Bilinear Interpolation and Image super-resolution using deep learning were analysed.
